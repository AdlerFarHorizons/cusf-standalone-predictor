# CUSF standalone predictor

Working on improving the Cambridge University Spaceflight landing predictor, used for predicting the flight path and landing location of latex balloons.  

## Install

The source for the standalone predictor is somewhere where nobody can find it, that'll be here when I can get hold of it. The GFS/DAP predictor is in the pred_src directory and building instructions can be found there.  

The webserver needs to have a connection timeout of 30+. The GFS data needs to be updated regularly, that script is part of the hourly predictor [here](http://www.github.com/rjw57/cusf-landing-prediction).

* Rob Anderson - The GRIB predictor  
* And Fergus Noble, Ed Moore and many others
